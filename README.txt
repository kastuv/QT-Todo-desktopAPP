A few months ago, I created a simple To-do App in QT while studying the book "Mastering QT 5." As a newcomer to QT development, I found this project to be invaluable as it covered essential concepts and functionalities suitable for beginners. The book itself was an excellent resource, and it has inspired me to take on more projects as I continue my learning journey.
